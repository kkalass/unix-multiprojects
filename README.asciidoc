MultiProjectSwitcher
====================

Helper scripts and conventions to support simple switching between different project setups.

Daily Usage
-----------

The main goal of those scripts is to make my daily work easier, and to provide simple means to switch different contexts on the commandline. 


Common aliases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each of my projectspecific setup-dev-env.sh files defines the variable CSW to point to the current source working directory
and the alias "cdw" to change to this current source working directory.

	CSW=$HOME/proj/someproject/
	alias cdw="cd $CSW"  # Change to the main (source) working directory of the current project

Shortcuts for Swichtching Context
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the multiprojects environment is setup correctly, an alias will be created for each
project. If you call that alias, the project-specific setup file will be sourced and your
working directory will be changed to $CSW of the named project.

--------------------------------------------
	$ # Will setup my current shell for the project 'csnotes'
	$ csnotes
	$ # typing 'cdw' will now lead me to the main working directory of csnotes
--------------------------------------------

Setup
